## function

- a function that calculate the coverage with tolerance of k variants

    '''
    def cal_coverage(population, start, end, k):
        pass
        return coverage
    '''

- a function that find the crossover point (short shrings of length = 8 where a epitope length = 9 that match in both sequences). (This is to make sure that local sequence are always found in nature sequences)

- prohibits excessive lengths to prevent redupication of repeats
